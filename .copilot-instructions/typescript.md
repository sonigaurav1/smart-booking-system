# TypeScript Best Practices

- Enforce strict type-safety; avoid “any” unless absolutely necessary.
- Prefer type aliases and interfaces over inline types.
- Make functions strongly typed, including return types.
- Use union types, generics, enums, and utility types effectively.
- Never ignore type errors. Fix root causes instead of casting.
- Prefer immutability when handling objects and arrays.
- Use `unknown` instead of `any` for external inputs.
- Validate all incoming API parameters and external data.
