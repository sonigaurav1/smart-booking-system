# React + Next.js Code Instructions

- Prefer functional components and modern React patterns.
- Use server components by default in Next.js 16+.
- Use client components only when needed (state, hooks, browser APIs).
- Keep components small, focused, and reusable.
- Derive state — avoid storing computed values in state.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders; use memoization when appropriate.
- Use async/await in server components for data fetching.
- Place server logic in server actions or Convex functions.
- Ensure all UI is accessible (labels, ARIA, keyboard).
- Follow Tailwind utility-first best practices.
- Use shadcn/ui components cleanly and idiomatically.
