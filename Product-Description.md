🔵 1. Who is Admin?
Admin = System Owner / Booking Platform Owner

Admin is NOT the developer (unless you choose to be both).
Admin is the person who owns or controls the entire booking platform.

Admin responsibilities:
    Manage all users and clients
    Approve or reject shop registrations
    Monitor bookings across the entire system
    Manage categories, service types, policies
    Handle complaints or issues
    Analytics for total bookings, transactions, usage

Admin access:

Admin sees everything:
    All shops
    All customers
    All bookings
    All revenue/usage data

Think of Admin as the owner of “UrbanClap / BookMyShow-like backend”.

🟢 2. Who is User?
User = Customer who books an appointment

This is the normal person who comes to the system to book a service like:
    Haircut
    Salon
    Doctor appointment
    Mechanic visit
    Massage
    Any shop service

User responsibilities:

Create an account (or book without login — optional)
    Book appointments
    View or cancel bookings
    Manage their profile
    Give reviews to shop

User access:

User sees:
    Shops
    Available slots
    Services
    Their own bookings only

Think of User as “the customer who is booking the appointment”.

🟠 3. Who is Client?
Client = Shop Owner / Service Provider

Client is the business that receives bookings from users.
Examples:
    Barber shop owner
    Salon owner
    Doctor clinic
    Car repair garage
    Spa center
    Gym owner

Client responsibilities:
    Create shop profile
    Add services, pricing, timings
    Accept / Reject bookings
    Manage daily schedule
    View weekly/monthly booking analytics
    Share public booking link to customers

Client access:

Client sees:
    Their own shop details
    Bookings made to their shop
    Their customer list
    Their revenue analytics (optional)

Think of Client as “the business owner receiving the booking”.

🎯 Simple Example to Understand All Three
Suppose you have a booking system called SmartBook.
1️⃣ Admin (You or your company)

You manage SmartBook platform:
    Approve new shops
    See total bookings
    Control the system

2️⃣ User (Customers)

Ramesh wants a haircut → goes to SmartBook → selects a barber → books a 6PM slot.

3️⃣ Client (Shop Owner)

"People’s Salon" owner receives the booking → sees Ramesh’s appointment → accepts it.
